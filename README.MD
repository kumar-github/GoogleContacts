# GoogleContacts

> **Every day is a learning day.**

This is a sample application for _beginners_ where we try to implement a clone of the _Google Contacts_ application.
We will start from scratch and add new features incrementally. We will be working only on the backend part and have no
plan of
implementing a frontend (_at least not in the near future_). We will start with an _in-memory_ storage approach and
slowly move towards _file_ storage and, later, a real _database_. We will build this as a _Standalone Command Line
Application_ and gradually convert it to a _Spring Boot REST Service_.
